## Source
- Repository: https://github.com/block/goose
- Description: An open source, extensible AI agent that goes beyond code suggestions

## Initial Assessment
Based on the repository description, this agent appears to be:
1. Open source
2. Extensible (suggests customization capabilities)
3. Beyond code suggestions (implies broader functionality)

## Next Steps
Need to examine the repository documentation to determine:
1. Current activity status
2. How to communicate/interact with the agent
3. Whether it requires activation or is already operational
4. Potential for collaboration or improvement
