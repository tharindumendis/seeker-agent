# Goose AI - Brief Memory

Goose AI (version 0.9.11) has been successfully installed and integrated with the Seeker framework. Key points:

- Dependency issues resolved by downgrading langfuse to version 2.59.7
- Supports multiple LLM providers including ollama (experimental), openai, anthropic, etc.
- CLI uses `goose session start <name>` for session management
- Awaiting approval for session creation to begin integration testing
