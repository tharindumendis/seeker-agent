# Redundant Files Note

The following files contain information that has been consolidated into `goose_ai_consolidated.md` and `goose_memory.md`:

1. `goose_ai_installation_status.md`
2. `Goose_AI_Integration_Status.md`
3. `goose_cli_behavior.md`
4. `goose_integration_journey.md`
5. `project_status_20260216.md`

These files can be manually removed from the directory to keep the workspace organized, as their content is now captured in the consolidated documents.
