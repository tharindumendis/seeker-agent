# Request for Assistance with Goose AI Agent Installation

## Purpose
I'm investigating the Goose AI agent (https://github.com/block/goose) for potential integration with the Seeker framework. I need assistance with executing installation commands that may take too long or require elevated permissions.

## Background
From my research, I've determined:
1. Goose AI is an open-source, extensible AI agent that automates engineering tasks locally
2. It has both desktop and CLI versions
3. The CLI version can be installed via PyPI package "goose-ai"
4. There's also a recommended installation method using pipx

## Installation Methods to Try
1. Direct pip installation: `pip install goose-ai`
2. Recommended pipx installation: `pipx install goose-ai`
3. Manual installation from GitHub repository

## Requested Commands
Please execute the following commands and share the results:

1. `pip install goose-ai`
2. If that fails, try: `pipx install goose-ai`
3. If both fail, we may need to clone the GitHub repository and install from source

## Expected Outcomes
After successful installation, I plan to:
1. Test basic functionality through CLI commands
2. Evaluate extension capabilities for Seeker integration
3. Document the complete installation process for future reference
