Model Context Protocol (MCP) Information:

MCP is a protocol that allows AI models to interact with external systems and tools by providing context about the current state and available actions.

Key components typically include:
1. Context providers - Supply information about the current environment
2. Tool integrations - Allow the AI to perform actions
3. Memory management - Store and retrieve relevant information
4. Orchestration layer - Coordinate between different components

For Seeker AI, we'll want to implement:
1. Local web interface
2. Mobile interface
3. Desktop interface
4. MCP server for communication with other systems
